\subsection{Response to: ``Two issues in the proofs"}
(Note this is all just a rough draft at the moment. Will refine later to make it sound friendly and professional.)
\subsubsection{Proof of Proposition 1}
The statement is more that for large enough $n$, we get an asymptotic bound that depends on $y$.

Having said that, the referee is right that we forgot to state assumptions on the prior distribution $q$.
It actually needs to belong to a conjugate family of prior distributions.

There are other steps in the proof that should have been written clearer.
We hope that our revision to the proof makes it easier to read \& understand now.
